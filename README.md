### Hi there 👋

I am an Open Source enthusiast always looking for new learning opportunities! 

I have a comfortable knowledge of Python, SQL, some Machine Learning libraries, and AWS services (I am a certified AWS Solutions Architect, and AWS Developer Associate).
In my tech career I have mostly worked as a Backend developer and SysAdmin. 
Now my goal is to level up to become a Full-Stack Developer, learning Ruby on Rails and ReactJS as my first steps into this new Realm.
<br><br>
My current interest is to collaborate on projects developed with these frameworks, but I like to play around with other languages and frameworks as well. 
<br><br>

Live long and prosper 🖖
